# Stream.as
Streaming I/O with AS3

## Motivation
Was wondering how to get data as it comes in using Flash. `URLStream` class makes this more or less out of the box.

## Why a GitHub repo?
I'll probably want to revisit this again at some point.

## Dependencies
* `npm`
* `mxmlc`

## Get started!

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

Now visit localhost:3000 and watch your console explode!
